GitHub Copilot Reflection:

How I used GitHub Copilot

Copilot helped me finish parts of the coding in my Expense Tracker app.
	- Creating the PieChart
	- Copilot suggested how to show my expenses as a PieChart with colors.


Suggestion I changed or rejected
	- Copilot suggested hardcoding the colors for each category, like always using red, blue, green.
	- I changed it so the colors cycle automatically depending on how many categories there are.


How Copilot saved me time
	- Copilot helped me finish the coding faster by suggesting codes or changes to my codes. 


Basic setup instructions:
    To set it up, run npm install to install all dependencies. After that, start the app by running npx expo start and scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone to open it. The app also allows you to filter expenses by all time, this week, or this month, and the PieChart updates automatically based on the data you enter.
